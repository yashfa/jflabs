                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The process of learning and achievement of excellence is a legacy of our glorious past. The chronicles of history bear witness to the fact that our predecessors pioneered and made gigantic leaps in various branches of sciences. We, therefore, are custodians of a trust vested in us. The turn of events and transgression from destined path have tilted the scales against us. At this point of time, vision with unflinching faith in our cause should be the guiding principle to turn the wheel and arrest further degradation of our potentials.Let us join hands to carry this noble mission to conclusive end under the banner of jf labs. </p>

                    <h2>geosynchronous satellite</h2>
                    <p>A geosynchronous satellite is a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, with an orbital period the same as the Earth's rotation period. Such a satellite returns to the same position in the sky after each sidereal day, and over the course of a day traces out a path in the sky that is typically some form of analemma.</p>

                    <p>The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development</p>

                    <p>The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion.</p>
