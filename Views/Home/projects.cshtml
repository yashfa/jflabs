                                <p>Since March 2001, International Space Station has supported continuous research operations. The facility actually opened for the business of science in September 2000, when the first experiments were launched to the outpost, even prior to the start of a permanent human presence. Since that time, even as construction of ISS has continued several dozens unique investigations have been completed or are still in progress. Most of the experiments are stored and operated in research racks inside the US laboratory module Destiny.</p>
